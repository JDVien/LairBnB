## Frontend Overview
The React rendering process involves the React source code being compiled into a Javascript function and returns a string of HTML rendered with our implemented LairBnB data. Styling was handled using CSS in JavaScript.


## Backend Overview
The backend is a collection of RESTful routes serving data to the frontend and an interface with the Postgres database.
